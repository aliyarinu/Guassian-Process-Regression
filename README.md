# Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) Exercises

This repository contains my learning notes, worked-out examples, and code implementations related to **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)**, based on the book *"Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning"* by **Carl Edward Rasmussen** and **Christopher K. I. Williams**.

#  Overview

Gaussian Processes (GPs) provide a powerful, non-parametric Bayesian framework for regression and probabilistic modeling.  
These exercises represent my journey to understand GPR from both a **mathematical** and **computational** perspective.

The content in this repository includes:


- Step-by-step derivations of the core equations of GPR  
- Implementation of Gaussian Processes from scratch in Python  
- Visualization of covariance functions (kernels) and their effects  
- Comparison of different kernel choices and hyperparameter optimization  
- Worked examples inspired by and adapted from *Rasmussen & Williams (2006)*  

> I will keep adding new notebooks and worked-out examples as I progress.
